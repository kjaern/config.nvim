# config.nvim
My neovim config, for now there are a few things specific to windows. Specifically python paths... Would like to get rid of these!

It assumes there is a conda env on this location:
%userprofile%\pythonNvim

In a miniconda terminal run:
conda create --prefix %userprofile%\pythonNvim -y python==3.11 pynvim
